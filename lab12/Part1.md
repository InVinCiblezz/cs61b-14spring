The histograms are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, each number corresponding to a different sorting algorithm you have seen in class. Identify each algorithm. How can you tell which is which? Which is fastest on the random data? What about the presorted data and the reverse sorted data?

One of the algorithms is quicksort. Which element does it choose for the pivot in a partition? (The pivot is not randomly chosen.) How can you tell?
